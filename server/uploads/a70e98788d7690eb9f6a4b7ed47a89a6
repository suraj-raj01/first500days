4/6/21, 1:47 PM - +91 16 91994: <Media omitted>
4/6/21, 1:47 PM - +91 16 91994: I'll share audios for Pronunciation which can help you.
4/6/21, 1:48 PM - +91 16 91994: Also from my experience I can share that a lot of times the pronunciation is very similar and is really hard to differentiate, so at the end practice becomes the key and then you'll know when to use which one
4/6/21, 1:49 PM - +91 16 91994: Kind of similar to English, in English also we learn spellings, that's how we know which vowel we have to use.
4/6/21, 2:00 PM - +91 00 38487: Yes please that's actually easy in learning and even helpful 👍
4/6/21, 2:10 PM - +91 16 91994: Sure, I'll share the Alphabets and the pronunciation by today.
4/6/21, 2:10 PM - +91 16 91994: Until then it would be great if the new members can introduce themselves and share which level they are on as of now.☺️

I am Akanksha from Noida, well i wanna learn korean for very obvious reason, BTS. So far have just started going through the pdfs shared and i have flash notes for learning everyday words. Korean is indeed difficult but i see as, they are humans too and if they can speak so i can master is too, in sometime.
4/6/21, 3:19 PM - +91 17 26326: Hello everyone! 
I’m Rhythm from Mumbai. The pandemic somehow got me to give K dramas a shot and I think it may have been one of the best decisions ever. I’ve fallen in love with the language and culture ever since and thus wanna learn Korean to be able to understand it first hand :) I’ve learnt the basics of Hangul from YouTube and wish to improve my vocab and sentence forming for starters. I also discovered this fun application called Drops if you guys wanna try, it’s a gamified version of learning vocab and one of the best applications I’ve seen for language learning. Looking forward to learning with you guys! :)

4/6/21, 3:41 PM - +91 57 88746: Hey hyndavi. I am thinking of applying to SNU. I want to do masters in computer science. Actually what I have understood is that language could be barrier , though they have courses in English as well. Their curriculum is also very different. They teach whole computer science but not specific majors like we have here in India like data science and all. I am targeting only SNU, other universities are not very good in global ranks. snu is amazing tho.
4/6/21, 3:48 PM - +91 60 04528: Hi guys 
Kalyani here from Mumbai. I want to pursue my masters from South Korea because they’ve got some exceptional modules. 
But before that, I’ll have to achieve at least a Level 5 in TOPIK. As my course is partially in Korean. Hence I’m here to learn the language 😄

I’m a movie buff and have always been intrigued by Korean Cinema! That’s how I figured out about the courses there. 
It’s nice to be a part of such a community! 🥰

4/6/21, 4:22 PM - +91 17 31870: Wow! Thank you so much for the info! I've always been curious (Although I'm done and dusted with education for life😄). But would there be any short term courses for specific majors in Korea and would they hold weight in your resume? If not, how do you want to go about it? And generally, how are the career opportunities like? In this field?
4/6/21, 4:35 PM - +91 57 88746: Koreans are amazing when it comes to technology. Samsung and all.  Yes there are certificate courses too. You can see the website 😁

4/6/21, 4:46 PM - +91 17 31870: Wow! I've met quite a few Koreans.. But they were only visiting India for business purposes. So they did not know our languages as such! This is amazing!
4/6/21, 4:47 PM - +91 94 69277: Sure, but he is very conservative & selective
4/6/21, 4:48 PM - +91 94 69277: He was in India for like 3 years, because his dad is marketing head of Hyundai Asia
4/6/21, 4:49 PM - +91 17 31870: Still an amazing feat. 3 years is not a long time to learn so many languages. And Hyundai is such a dream company 😍

4/7/21, 12:28 AM - +91 75 78255: And how?
4/7/21, 12:29 AM - +91 23 73889: YouTube
4/7/21, 12:29 AM - +91 23 73889: And multiple sources
4/7/21, 12:29 AM - +91 23 73889: It’s the easiest script to learn
4/7/21, 12:30 AM - +91 26 61274: 어 진짜요? 푸네는 너무 이쁜 도시입니다
4/7/21, 12:30 AM - +91 26 61274: Learnt a bit, still practicing
4/7/21, 12:30 AM - +91 26 61274: Yes
4/7/21, 12:30 AM - +91 75 78255: Are these like korean words or English words written in korean script ?
4/7/21, 12:30 AM - +91 23 73889: You can literally just google it and talktomeinkorean and multiple sites. I actually don’t remember my sources because I learnt it almost a decade ago on my own
4/7/21, 12:31 AM - +91 26 61274: Korean words

4/7/21, 12:32 AM - +91 23 73889: 제 생각에는 뭄바이가 더 예쁜데 ... 푸네에서 사람들이 뭄바이보다 적어서 제거 푸네 더 좋아해요
4/7/21, 12:33 AM - +91 80 52800: Learnt the script!
4/7/21, 12:34 AM - +91 23 73889: 근데 뭄바이에 바닷가가 있어서 그건 만 보고싶어요 ㅠ.ㅠ
4/7/21, 12:36 AM - +91 26 61274: 네. 뭄바이는 제일 이뻐! 제가 너무 사랑한 도시이예요!
4/7/21, 12:37 AM - +91 26 61274: 바다는 매우 평화 롭다
4/7/21, 12:41 AM - +91 23 73889: 그렇군요... 
제가 뭄바이에 있는 바닷가 빼고 아무것도 좋지 않아요. 왜냐하면, 날씨가 아주 불편하고 사람들도 아주 많아요. 제가 그런 장수가 좀 안 좋아해요.

어, 그리고 뭄바이 음식도 많이 좋아해요
4/7/21, 12:46 AM - +91 23 73889: 그지 ~
특히 밤에 바다 소리가 아름답고 마음에 들어요
4/7/21, 12:47 AM - +91 26 61274: 다 다르니까 ...저도 알아요. 근데 이 도시 많이 사람 한테 금같아 있어
4/7/21, 12:47 AM - +91 23 73889: 금이요? Do you mean 꿈?
4/7/21, 12:48 AM - +91 26 61274: 모든 것이 사실이다

4/7/21, 9:18 AM - +91 59 59465: Question!! Do we have someone who is teaching and helping us learn or is it just us texting here and getting pdfs. and voice messages.  cause, for me, I need someone to at least lead me into some verbal teachings.
4/7/21, 9:20 AM - +91 18 00680: I think there will be a formal teacher teaching us. Coz that's what was mentioned in the community
4/7/21, 9:21 AM - +91 3 895 054: Yeahhh... I guess we have our mentor
4/7/21, 9:22 AM - +91 64 64951: Me too 💜

4/7/21, 9:24 AM - +91 64 64951: Yess
4/7/21, 9:25 AM - +91 64 64951: I think it's hwaiting
4/7/21, 9:27 AM - +91 18 00680: Actually hwaiting / fighting is a derived word so neither is actually wrong or right😊
4/7/21, 9:28 AM - +91 57 52886: I think it's actually fighting but their pronounce is different
4/7/21, 9:29 AM - +91 64 64951: Ohh i didn't know that bcoz a lot of words are similar to English so I thought its hwaiting and not fighting thanks for letting me know 😊
4/7/21, 9:29 AM - +91 18 00680: Its derived from english and since hangul doesn't have any letter for "f" so its pronounced that way
4/7/21, 9:31 AM - +91 18 00680: So fighting can be written as "파이팅 (paiting)" or "와이팅 (hwaiting)" in hangul
4/7/21, 9:32 AM - +91 18 00680: So in english fighting is hhe word 😁
4/7/21, 9:32 AM - +91 66 52336: 💪🏻Fighting🤭
4/7/21, 9:33 AM - +91 18 00680: 😁😁

4/7/21, 12:32 PM - +91 95 31948: But yukta always informs us before scheduling the class
4/7/21, 12:32 PM - +91 95 31948: Because the classes are not regularly held
4/7/21, 12:32 PM - +91 95 31948: Like last Sunday there was no class
